Installation instructions:

1. Install Java SDK https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
2. Install Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwbaa59vV4AIVQx-tBh1tmw74EAAYASABEgILt_D_BwE
3. Download the zip version of the GitHub project and unzip it
4. In Android Studio select "Open Project From Folder"
5. Locate the the unzipped folder and select it

To run the app you'll unfortunately have to connect your own phone, the shake emulation on Android Emulator didn't work for us (it's supposed to be CMD + M on Mac and CTRL + M on Windows)

To connect your own Android phone, you'll have to allow USB Debugging in the settings of your phone and become a developer by tapping the Build Number in settings several times (until the phone tells you that you're in a developer mode)

Once you've done all that and are connected, press the green "play arrow" in the top right corner of Android Studio and your phone should appear in the Device Menu, select and run it.
